    "We won't cover this in great detail, but here are the important parts of the `StructureDefinition`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `resourceType` - every FHIR resource has to declare what type it is\n",
    "- `baseDefinition` - this points to the `StructureDefinition` that the current one extends. It doesn't have to be one of the base FHIR definitions. It could come from any FHIR data model. This is one of the features of FHIR that helps achieve interoperability.\n",
    "- `url` - this is a required unique identifier for a `Conformance Resource`. It is a stable [canonical identifier](http://hl7.org/fhir/resource.html#canonical) for the resource and is never intended to change regardless of which FHIR server uses it.\n",
    "- `fhirVersion` - the FHIR semantic version number is required. It will instruct  anything validating this resource to use R4 (4.0.0) validation logic.\n",
    "- `differential` or `snapshot` - Every `StructureDefinition` must have either a `differential` - a section of content that specifies differences from the base definition, or a `snapshot` section which specifies the full definition. For model development, you almost always use the `differential` section and not the `snapshot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Canonical URL**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Canonical URLs do not need to be live URLs. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's say `StructureDefinition` A points to `StructureDefinition` B via it's `baseDefinition` attribute. In order for `StructureDefinition` A to pass validation by a FHIR server, `StructureDefinition` B MUST be already be loaded in the FHIR server.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Min and Max Data Types** \n",
    "\n",
    "    You may have noticed that the data types for `min` and `max` differ. This is because `max`    can be set to a number or `*` which means many/unlimited, while `min` can only be set to a     number."

    "You might be wondering why adding a new attribute isn't as simple as removing an attribute. There are a couple of reasons for this. The primary reason is because the FHIR spec pushes for interoperability through sharing of model components like extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since extensions are defined in their own files, they can be reused in a plug and play fashion by other models. We will see this later in the tutorial when we reuse the `karyotypic-sex`extension defined by the [Phenopackets FHIR model](https://aehrc.github.io/fhir-phenopackets-ig/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, if you don't care about making your attributes shareable and/or you only care about simple key-value type attributes, FHIR does not have a simpler way to define these right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple and Complex Extensions\n",
    "Another reason why extensions may be complex is because they can represent both simple attributes or complex attributes. A simple attribute might be a key:value pair with a primitive data type, and a complex attribute might be an entirely new structure that might have several other extensions in a nested hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡️ **Key Takeaway - Reuse existing extensions as much as possible! This is a major benefit of FHIR**"

    "```\n",
    "- `id`: This must uniquely identify the object in the `differential.element` list. It does not need to be equal to `path` but often times it is, since `path` can uniquely identify the object in the `differential.element` list.\n",
    "- `path`: This is equal to the fully qualified location of the attribute in the resource payload. All extensions go inside an `extension` element in the Patient resource. \n",
    "- `slicing`: The `Patient.extension` is a list of extensions and each one must be able to be uniquely identified in that list. The extension's URL is used to \"slice\" or identify the extension in the list.\n",
    "- `ordered=False`: order of extensions does not matter in a Patient resource\n",
    "- `rules=open`: additional extensions can be added in a Patient resource\n",

    "\n",
    "This section will help you understand exactly what these terms mean, how they differ, and how they can be used in your FHIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Terminology or an Ontology?\n",
    "Let's start with the very basics. A data model at its core is really just a collection of concepts and how they relate to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An example - biological sex**\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept describes some entity in the world or an attribute of some entity in the world. For example, in our model we have a concept called Patient. Our Patient concept also has concepts which describe it - one which we don't have yet but want is biological `sex`.  \n",

    "Now, how does one know what the concept `sex` actually means semantically? And what kinds of values the attribute `sex` on Patient can take on? This is exactly what a terminology service or ontology defines. It also defines how concepts are related to each other (i.e. tree like, graph like, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Same concept in different ontologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept can be defined in multiple ontologies. For example, try the following search in your browser to see which ontologies the term `sex` is included in:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coded Value\n",
    "In FHIR a `code` is an alphanumeric string (e.g. \"433152004\") used to unambiguously identify a specific concept (e.g. the concept \"male\", defined as a human with X and Y chromosomes) within a particular ontology (e.g. SNOMED CT).\n",

    "Before we create a `SearchParameter` resource for our new attribute, it is worth noting a few interesting features of the FHIR search spec when it comes to searching for attributes which have coded values. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Token Type SearchParameter\n",
    "If you recall from the [SearchParameter Types](#SearchParameter-Types) section, a `SearchParameter` can take on different types. Each type has a set of modifiers that can be used with it which change what is being searched for (e.g. `/Patients?gender:not=male` gender is a token type parameter and is allowed to use the modifier `not`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A `token` type search parameter is different from a regular `string` because it provides a close to exact match search on a string of characters, **potentially scoped by a URI**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for `token` search parameters, matches are case sensitive by default unless the context which it appears specifies otherwise (e.g. `CodeSystem.caseSensitive=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coded Attributes Use Token Type\n",
    "The `token` search parameter type is used in search parameters for coded attributes since a coded attribute will usually take on one of the FHIR data types: `Coding` or `CodeableConcept` - both of which are scoped by the `CodeSystem` URI \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Search Works for Coded Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a `SearchParameter` defined for our `sex` extension. This extension has a FHIR data type of `CodeableConcept`. If you recall our example Patient had `sex` populated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patient.sex**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"valueCodeableConcept\": {\n",
    "    \"coding\": [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"code\": \"XY\",\n",
    "            \"system\": \"http://fhir.kids-first.io/CodeSystem/biological-sex\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    \"text\": \"Male\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search sex=XY**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do a search like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/Patient?sex=XY\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actual Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a `CodeableConcept` data type, the server knows to execute the search like this: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Search all Patients and check if any Patient.sex.coding.code matches \"XY\" exactly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifiers with Token Type\n",
    "You can change this search behavior with the modifiers that are supported for `token` type search parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the modifiers that can be used with `token` type search parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Token SearchParameter Type Modifiers](static/images/token-type-modifiers.png)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#token)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Search Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some search examples for the `Condition` resource. `Condition.code` is a `CodeableConcept` type attribute which identifies the condition, problem or diagnosis for a `Patient`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search by code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Find Conditions where any of the Condition.code.codings.code value matches `ha125`, \n",
    "regardless of the ontologies/CodeSystems the code appears in.\n",

    "in the `http://acme.org/conditions/codes` CodeSystem.\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET [base]/Condition?code=http://acme.org/conditions/codes|ha125\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search using text of CodeableConcept**\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for any Condition with a code that has the text \"headache\" associated with it (either in `CodeableConcept.text` or `Coding.display`), regardless of the ontology/CodeSystems.\n",
    "```\n",
