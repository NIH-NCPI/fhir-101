# 🔥 FHIR 101 - A Practical Guide

## Quickstart

## Hello there!

If any of the following statements applies or questions below apply to you,
then this guide is for you :)

- 🤷‍♀️ I've heard the term FHIR. But is it a server? A database? A data model? Rapid oxidation?
- 🙀 I understand what FHIR is but have no idea how to begin implementing it!
- 😕 I tried reading through HL7 FHIR, but I am still confused
- 🤔 How does FHIR modeling compare to relational database design?

## What is this Guide?
The FHIR 101 guide is an online Jupyter Notebook deployed with
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). That means its publically hosted and
you can play with it in your browser.

The primary purpose of the notebook is to quickly educate you on what FHIR is
and to walk you through practical exercises that will teach you the FHIR basics:

- What is FHIR
- What do the data look like
- How to use Python to query databases 
- How to use FHIR RESTful API to identify the data model and query the server 

You can read through the notebook to learn about FHIR concepts and execute
notebook code cells in the tutorial section to see practical examples.

More Notebooks are coming to learn how to create or modify the data model, 
and how manage the data linked to the model.
